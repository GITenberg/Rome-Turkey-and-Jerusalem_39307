<h2><a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>FOREWORD TO FOURTH IMPRESSION.</h2>
<p>Those of us who have been watching political events from the
prophetical standpoint, have seen during the last thirty years
the steady drying up of that overflowing river which once flooded
Europe.&nbsp; Turkey&rsquo;s fate we knew to be certain, but
there were fluctuations so we had to be patient.</p>
<p>Two years ago when writing the Foreword and notes to the first
reprint of this little book, I drew attention to the
&ldquo;amazing collapse&rdquo; of Turkey&rsquo;s power
&ldquo;during the last few months.&rdquo;&nbsp; Half a year later
it seemed as if only a thread of littoral would be left to Turkey
in Europe; then came a certain apparent return of vigour as when
the ebbing tide sends back a wave that seems to claim once more
part of the dominion it had lost; just in the same way Turkey
regained some of the territory wrested from it during the Balkan
War, and we who were watching wondered for how long this would
be.</p>
<p>One year and a half has passed and now it really seems as if
the clock had struck.&nbsp; Only a few days ago the daily papers
told the world that Turkey, deluded, or bribed, or both, had
thrown in her lot with Germany.&nbsp; In a leading article dated
Nov. 2, &ldquo;The Times&rdquo; summed up the matter
thus&mdash;&ldquo;Whatever may be the <a name="pagev"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. v</span>immediate consequences of Turkish
intervention, there is a general consensus of opinion throughout
the world that it means the end of Turkey.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bible
students grasped the situation at once recognizing the immense
significance of the event, and on the same day at the C.M.S.
Anniversary at Exeter I pointed out the overwhelming importance
of this intelligence, in connection with Missionary work, the
future of the Jewish Nation and our Lord&rsquo;s Return.&nbsp; I
have heard from Jerusalem of the keen excitement of the Jews
there, and of the hope often expressed that England would take
action on their behalf.&nbsp; The secular press in many quarters
is already suggesting that the Allies at the conclusion of the
War might well establish the Jews in Palestine as a buffer-state;
this is exactly what some of us have for many years pointed out,
from the study of prophecy, as a likely solution of the near
Eastern question.&nbsp; Perhaps, it may be so&mdash;God&rsquo;s
promises unfold very quickly when the time for their appearance
is ripe.&nbsp; Our business is to watch and pray, giving the Lord
no rest till He establish and until He make Jerusalem a praise on
the earth, and above all constantly sending forth the cry of His
waiting Church&mdash;&ldquo;even so, come Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>FORWARD</h2>
<p>It is now thirty-six years since these remarkable sermons were
preached by the late Canon Hoare.&nbsp; Published at the time,
they had a very large circulation and passed through several
editions.&nbsp; An earnest desire having been manifested for
their re-issue with the addition of some footnotes bringing them
up to date, I have consented to undertake that simple
office.&nbsp; With happy memories of work under the beloved Vicar
long ago (1877&ndash;81) there is, to me, something indescribable
in being permitted once more in this unexpected way to unite with
one who now within the Veil walks not by faith but by sight and
who instead of knowing but in part now <i>knows</i> even as also
he is known.</p>
<p>It is a great tribute to the sagacity of the preacher, his
deep knowledge of Scripture, and his keen prophetic instincts,
that these sermons need no alteration, and only the necessary
additions demanded by the history of passing years.</p>
<p><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>The
advance has been all along the exact lines which he as a diligent
student of the prophetic Scriptures was able to lay down.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The wise shall understand&rdquo; (Daniel xii. 10) is a
promise which we see here strikingly fulfilled.</p>
<p>Could the venerable preacher have seen the extraordinary
developments that have taken place in Jerusalem and the Holy Land
during the last few years, or the amazing collapse of the
Mohammedan power which Europe has witnessed in the past few
months, how his heart would have rejoiced at the fulfilment of
Scriptural predictions, and how earnestly would he have
proclaimed afresh His Master&rsquo;s Words&mdash;&ldquo;When ye
shall see these things, know that He is nigh, even at the
doors.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>PUBLISHER&rsquo;S NOTE.</h3>
<p>It is a source of pleasure to the Editor, the Publisher, and
all those interested in the re-issue of this book, to know that a
further edition is so soon called for, and to receive so many
testimonies to its usefulness as a Guide to the Prophecies of
Holy Writ.</p>

<h3>I.<br />
THE OUTLINE.</h3>
<p>It is impossible to imagine anything more delightful than the
prospect of the promised return of our most blessed
Saviour.&nbsp; How do the father and the mother feel when they
welcome their long-absent son from India?&nbsp; How will many an
English wife feel when she welcomes her husband from the Arctic
Expedition?&nbsp; And how must the Church of God feel when, after
her long night of toil and difficulty, she stands face to face
before Him whom her soul loveth, and enters into the full
enjoyment of the promise, &lsquo;So shall we ever be with the
Lord?&rsquo;&nbsp; There will be no tears then, for there will be
no sorrow; no death then, for <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>there will be no more curse; no sin
then, for we shall see Him as He is, and shall be like Him.&nbsp;
Then will be the time of resurrection, when all the firstborn of
God shall awake to a life without decay and without corruption;
and then the time of reunion, when the whole company of
God&rsquo;s elect shall stand together before the Lord, never
again to shed a tear over each other&rsquo;s grave; and then will
be the time when those who have loved and longed after Him, as
they have journeyed on alone in their pilgrimage, will find
themselves on the right hand of His throne, and hear His
delightful words, &lsquo;Come, ye blessed children of my Father:
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>No wonder then that the people of God are waiting with anxious
hearts for the Advent; and no wonder that many are ready to say,
&lsquo;Lord, how long?&rsquo; and to ask, What hope is there of
His quick return?&nbsp; Have we, or have we not, any reason <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>to look out for
it soon?&nbsp; To this inquiry I would endeavour to draw your
attention this morning; and in doing so, I do not intend to
examine into what are usually called &lsquo;the signs of the
times,&rsquo; but to study the great prophetic sketch of the
world&rsquo;s history as given to us by the prophet Daniel.&nbsp;
This may be termed the backbone of prophecy, and almost all the
great prophecies of Holy Scripture fit into it at some point or
other; so that, if we wish to understand them, we must begin by
studying it.&nbsp; I fear I may not interest those who aim simply
to have their hearts warmed by the ministry.&nbsp; But they must
remember that the real study of God&rsquo;s Word requires work,
and that work, though it lays the best possible foundation for
feeling, does not at the time excite it.&nbsp; To-day, then, we
are to work, and I hope the Lord may so bless His Word, that
through work we may be led to feel.</p>
<p>Our business, then, is to endeavour to discover whether the
great prophetic sketch <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of history, given through the prophet
Daniel, encourages the blessed hope that the coming of the Lord
may be near.&nbsp; Daniel gives a prophecy of the history of
political power from his own day till the time when &lsquo;the
Ancient of Days shall sit,&rsquo; and describes a succession of
events which must take place in the interval.&nbsp; It is clear
that our business is to ascertain how many of these events have
taken place, or, in other words, how far we have advanced in the
series.</p>
<p>In the study of our subject we have the advantage of looking
at two sides of the picture, for it has pleased God to give us
the same series as seen in two different aspects.&nbsp; In the
second and seventh chapters you will find predictions of the same
events under different figures.&nbsp; In the second chapter the
prophecy is given as a vision to a proud, idolatrous
monarch.&nbsp; So the different kingdoms about to arise appear to
him as the several parts of a mighty image, with himself as the
head of <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>gold.&nbsp; It was given in just such a shape as should
coincide with his idolatry and his pride.&nbsp; Whereas, in the
seventh chapter, the vision is given to one of God&rsquo;s
people, and he sees in all this glory nothing better than a
series of wild beasts coming up one after another to
devour.&nbsp; How different is the estimate of the world from
that of God!&nbsp; The world regards Babylon as the head of gold,
the summit of glory and greatness, while God looks on it as a
savage beast, to be dreaded by His saints!&nbsp; The same
difference of character may be observed in the visions of the
coming of the Lord.&nbsp; To the great king it appeared as a
triumphant kingdom, to the captive prophet as a manifestation of
the Son of man.&nbsp; The one saw a kingdom, the other a person;
the one, the overthrow of power, the other, the advent of the
Lord of Glory.</p>
<p>But now let us look at the series.&nbsp; In both prophecies
there is a description of four kingdoms which should in
succession be supreme in political power, and which <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>should fill up
an interval between Daniel and the Advent.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There is the head of gold in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s
image, the same as the lion in the vision of Daniel.&nbsp; The
most precious of metals corresponding to the king of beasts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There is next the breast and arms of silver,
corresponding to the bear of Daniel.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; After that the belly and thighs of brass,
representing the same nation as the leopard of the prophet.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And following them is the last kingdom of the four,
represented to Nebuchadnezzar as the &lsquo;legs of iron, and the
feet, part of iron and part of clay,&rsquo; and to Daniel as a
beast, &lsquo;dreadful and terrible, and strong
exceedingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe how the same iron character is
attributed to this last power in both visions.&nbsp; In the one
we read of it, chap. ii. 40, &lsquo;The fourth kingdom shall be
strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth
all things; and as <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>iron that breaketh all things, shall it break in pieces
and bruise.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in the other, chap. vii. 7, it is
said to be &lsquo;strong exceedingly, and it had great iron
teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue
with the feet of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is the series of kingdoms that were to hold the chief
political power of the world, and fill up the whole interval
between the date of the prophecy and the advent of the
Lord.&nbsp; Now the remarkable, and I believe I may say the
indisputable, fact, is that, according to the prophecy, all these
four kingdoms have arisen.&nbsp; They have followed each other
exactly as it was predicted.&nbsp; Babylon was the head of gold,
or the lion.&nbsp; The Medes and Persians were the breast of
silver, or the bear.&nbsp; Greece, always called &lsquo;the
brazen armed,&rsquo; in classic poetry, was the belly and the
thighs of brass, or the leopard.&nbsp; And then the mighty power
of Rome, far exceeding all the others in its terrible strength,
with the legs of iron in the royal image, and the teeth of iron
in <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the
prophetic beast.&nbsp; Thus far there is an agreement almost
unanimous among the students of prophetic Scripture; and the
conclusion certainly is, that we have already been a long time
under the last of the four successive empires of the world.&nbsp;
So far then as those four empires are concerned, we are
encouraged to entertain the strong hope that, as we have reached
the last kingdom in the succession, we may begin hopefully to
look out for the end.&nbsp; We have passed the last station on
the line, so now we may begin to prepare for home.</p>
<p>But again.&nbsp; There is one remarkable difference between
the fourth kingdom and the other three, viz., this, that its
history is divided into two periods, during the first of which it
appears as an undivided power, and during the second split up
into ten.&nbsp; In chap. ii. 41, it says, &lsquo;the kingdom
shall be divided.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this divided period it is
represented by the ten toes on the image, and the ten horns on
the beast.&nbsp; The ten toes are described as kings, or kingdoms
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>in chap. ii.
44; and so are the ten horns in chap. vii. 24, where it is said,
&lsquo;The ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
arise.&rsquo;&nbsp; So then the prophecy teaches us that when
Rome had overpowered Greece it would go on for a time as one
mighty undivided empire, but that after a time it would break up
into a cluster of kingdoms, and that this cluster would retain
amongst them the supremacy of the world.&nbsp; It does not
describe any fresh shift of political supremacy to any new
kingdom that should arise, or the loss or decay of that
supremacy.&nbsp; But it teaches that there would be a division in
the kingdom, that the parts should fall asunder, and that, while
the iron of the fourth kingdom would remain amongst them, there
should be so much clay mixed up with it, that it should never
again be united under a single head.</p>
<p>Now this is exactly what has happened.&nbsp; In the days of
the C&aelig;sars united Rome was supreme in the pomp of the iron
empire.&nbsp; Its body was Europe, and its heart was the <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>emperor.&nbsp; It was one as much as Babylon had been
one under Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; But look at it now.&nbsp; There
is all the old power; for Europe and its races practically govern
the world.&nbsp; It has not lost its iron.&nbsp; But there is no
one kingdom that embodies all.&nbsp; The power is vested in a
cluster of independent nations.&nbsp; Many attempts have been
made to combine them: some by conquest, as in the case of
Napoleon; some by negotiation, as in the case of the Spanish
marriages.&nbsp; But all in vain, for the toes are irrecoverably
divided, and whatever is done, though as an aggregate they retain
their power, as individual nations they are always
distinct.&nbsp; I have no time to enter into detail, but I regard
this division as a most remarkable fulfilment of the prophetic
word. <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; More than five hundred years
before the coming of the Lord there was a captive in Babylon, and
God so directed that man&rsquo;s mind, as through him to
communicate to <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>the world even then the present position of modern
Europe.&nbsp; With such a fact before us who can doubt the
inspiration of the prophet, or the statement of St. Peter, that
&lsquo;holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, without stopping to consider the wonders of the prophecy,
let us learn the lesson which it teaches us with reference to the
nearness of the Advent.&nbsp; We have already found that we have
long since reached the fourth kingdom of the series; and now we
are led a step further, and find that we have long since reached
the second period of that kingdom.&nbsp; It is difficult with
accuracy to assign a date, for the transition was gradual; but we
shall be sufficiently near if we say that it practically took
place between twelve and fourteen hundred years ago.&nbsp; And
when we reflect on such a promise as that in Daniel ii. 44, in
which God assures us of a kingdom that shall be set up in the
days of these kings, and never be destroyed: when we consider
that those <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>kings have already been reigning through that lengthened
period, it is surely time that we begin to look out for that
which is to come; for the happy and blessed day when we shall
welcome the kingdom which shall never be moved, and when Christ
Himself shall reign in glory.</p>
<p>But this is not all, for, although we shall learn no more from
the vision of the king, we may gather much more from that of the
prophet, for in it we find a most important additional
prophecy.&nbsp; I can perfectly understand why it was given by
the prophet, and not by the king, for I believe it to refer to
the religious history of Europe, and the king of course had no
concern with that.&nbsp; He did not care for religion, or for the
saints of God.&nbsp; I allude to the prophecy of the little horn
rising in the midst of the other ten.&nbsp; I have no time to
discuss arguments, and can merely state conclusions.&nbsp; All,
therefore, that I can do now is to express my own convictions on
two points:</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>1.&nbsp; That the little horn diverse from all the rest
is the Papal power.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the time, times, and dividing of a time, which
is to be the limit of its power, stands in prophetic figure for
1260 years.</p>
<p>If this be correct it gives some idea as to the duration of
the second division of the last kingdom, for it shows that it
must last at least 1260 years.&nbsp; Still more, as the Papacy is
to be destroyed at the approach of the Ancient of Days, if we
could only ascertain the date of its commencement we might
calculate the date of the Advent.&nbsp; But here is the
difficulty, for who can say when a horn begins to grow? and who
can determine the date of the first swelling of Papal
pride?&nbsp; It is impossible to make any such calculation, and I
believe it would be wrong to attempt it.&nbsp; But we may still
be led by the great outline to hope for the approach of that most
blessed day.&nbsp; The horn has been growing a long time, and it
is impossible to read European history without believing that the
1260 years cannot <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>be very far from its close.&nbsp; Everything therefore
looks like an approaching end.&nbsp; We have long since reached
the fourth kingdom; long since reached its second, or divided
period; and, though we cannot say when it took place, we have
long since seen the commencement of the 1260 years of the little
horn.&nbsp; Surely then it is high time that we be looking out
for the coming of the Lord, high time that we be watching with
our loins girt and our lamps burning, and we ourselves as those
that wait for their Lord.</p>
<p>With these facts before us, I may fairly ask any thinking
person, whether there is not good ground for the hope that the
coming of the Lord draweth nigh?&nbsp; You observe I have not
dwelt on minute and isolated points.&nbsp; I have taken the great
outline of the world&rsquo;s history, and compared it with the
great outline of the word of prophecy.&nbsp; I see that the two
exactly correspond.&nbsp; I thank God from the bottom of my heart
for the evidence given of the <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>inspiration of Scripture, for no such
prophecy could have had its origin with man; and, while I thank
God for such a confirmation of the faith, I cannot resist the
conclusion that we have nearly reached the end of the series,
that we are living in the last part of the last period of the
last kingdom, and that the next great event of this prophecy is
nothing else than the sitting of the Ancient of Days, the
glorious kingdom of the Son of Man.</p>
<p>But do we all desire it?&nbsp; Are we all looking out with
loving and longing hearts for the appearance of our beloved
Redeemer?&nbsp; I fear that many would be very far from glad if
they thought it would come to-morrow.&nbsp; Their own consciences
tell them they are not ready, and in such a case how can they
desire it?&nbsp; You might say to them, as in the words of the
prophet, &lsquo;To what end is the day of the Lord to you? the
day of the Lord is darkness and not light.&rsquo;&nbsp; I believe
it to be impossible for any man really to desire the coming of
Christ as his <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>king until in his own soul he is personally acquainted
with Him as his sin-offering or atonement.&nbsp; Thus I believe
that you will find very few really desire the Advent who have not
practically and experimentally drunk in the great doctrine of
justification by faith.&nbsp; If you are reconciled through the
precious blood of Christ; if you are justified in the
righteousness of Christ; if you are preserved and sanctified by
the loving Spirit of Christ, then of course you will be ready to
say, &lsquo;Even so, come, Lord Jesus; come quickly.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But if you are still living for the world, content with the
world&rsquo;s gifts and the world&rsquo;s enjoyments; or even if
you are still toiling, and struggling on to reach Him you know
not how, and know not whether you may trust Him to place you on
the right hand of the throne or not, how is it possible that you
should be happy in waiting for Him?&nbsp; Never rest, therefore,
till you stand accepted in Him; till you have good reason to
believe that you are safe, and not safe only, but beloved.&nbsp;
Then <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>you
may wait for Him, then you may welcome Him, then He cannot come
too soon to please you; and if His sign is seen even to-night you
will be able to say, &lsquo;This is our God; we have waited for
Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for
Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.&rsquo;</p>

THE CONSUMPTION.</h3>
<p>I endeavoured in the last lecture to bring before you the
blessed hope of our Lord&rsquo;s return, and to show, from the
great outlines of prophecy, that there is enough to justify the
expectations of those who humbly trust that we shall not have
much longer to wait.&nbsp; I purposely avoided any reference to
what are called the &lsquo;signs of the times,&rsquo; and
confined your attention exclusively to what may be called the
great backbone of prophecy, <i>i.e.</i>, to the prophetic history
of the four mighty kingdoms which were foretold as holding the
empire of the world.&nbsp; From that outline I endeavoured to
show that these four great kingdoms were to arise in succession,
one after the other, and that they would fill up the interval
between the time of the prophecy and the sitting of the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Ancient of
Days.&nbsp; I hope, also, I made it plain from history that three
of those kingdoms have long since fallen, and that, as far as the
predicted periods enable us to judge, we must be drawing near to
the close of the fourth.&nbsp; The great outline, therefore,
leads to the hope that the time of the glorious kingdom of our
blessed Lord may be near.&nbsp; But, though we did not study the
signs of the times then, I do not think we should undervalue
them, for our blessed Saviour foretold certain things that should
take place, and added, &lsquo;When ye shall see all these things,
know that it <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a> is near, even at the
doors.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, therefore, any of these things are now
taking place, it is clear that we ought to study them; and that
we should not be really carrying out the teaching of the Lord
Jesus if we were to neglect them.&nbsp; I propose, therefore, in
obedience to His words, to bring before you in this lecture what
has long appeared to me one of the most conclusive signs <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>that the time
is not very far distant.&nbsp; I allude to the present position
of the Church of Rome, and I earnestly hope that God has directed
my thoughts in the study of it, and that whatever in what I may
now say is according to His word, may be written in all our
hearts and minds by the teaching of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>There are three great historical prophecies, which, in the
opinion of the majority of our best expositors, predict the rise,
the progress, and the fall of the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>The first of these we briefly noticed last Sunday.&nbsp; It is
the prophecy of the little horn rising amidst the ten horns of
the beast, or the Papacy rising in the midst of that cluster of
European kingdoms which succeeded the power of the undivided
Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The second is the prophecy of &lsquo;the man of sin&rsquo; in
2 Thess. ii.&nbsp; And I cannot forbear the mention of one
illustration of a verse in that prophecy which I saw myself <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>in
Rome.&nbsp; Many people think that the description in the fourth
verse is too strong for Popery: but there is a curious
illustration of it in St. Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; You may there see
what they call the altar in the usual place at the end of the
chancel, and above it, surrounded by an elaborately decorated
reredos, is what is called the chair of St. Peter, or the
Pope&rsquo;s throne, the seat of Papal power.&nbsp; On the altar
below, according to their own teaching, is the living person of
the King of Glory, perfect man and perfect God, and in front of
that altar may be seen men worshipping the wafer because they
call it God.&nbsp; But above it is the Pope&rsquo;s chair, and if
he were to occupy it he would sit there with that which they call
God, and worship as God, beneath his feet.&nbsp; Can anything be
a more exact fulfilment of the words, &lsquo;Exalteth himself
above all that is called God, or that is worshipped?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The third is the prophecy of the woman in Rev. xvii.&nbsp; The
application of this to <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the Church of Rome is less disputed
than that of either of the other two, for the seat of the woman
is decided by the 9th verse to be the seven-hilled city, which is
almost universally admitted to be Rome.</p>
<p>Now it is not my object to study the details of these
prophecies, and there is only one point to which I invite your
careful attention&mdash;one most important point common to all
three, viz., that the final overthrow will be preceded by a
consuming process.&nbsp; It will not be a sudden destruction in
the height of prosperity, but will be the final act after a
period of wasting and defeat.&nbsp; If these three passages refer
to Rome, as I fully believe they do, then Rome will be first
consumed and then destroyed.</p>
<p>In Daniel it says (vii. 26), &lsquo;The judgment shall
sit.&rsquo;&nbsp; It seems clear from the context, that this does
not mean the great day of judgment, but the commencement of
judgment on her sins here upon earth.&nbsp; &lsquo;And they shall
take away his dominion to consume <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>and to destroy it unto the
end.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is, therefore, a consuming process before
the end.&nbsp; The word here rendered &lsquo;consume&rsquo;
conveys the idea of a gradual process, and not a sudden blow; and
teaches us that there will be a wasting before the final
overthrow.</p>
<p>In 2 Thess. ii. 8, exactly the same process is described, and
in almost the same words: &lsquo;Whom the Lord shall consume with
the spirit of his mouth, and destroy with the brightness of his
coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; He will first consume him by His word, and
ultimately destroy him at His advent.</p>
<p>It is just the same in Rev. xvii.&nbsp; There you meet with
the old beast, the ten-horned beast of Daniel; and ten horns
still representing ten kings; and when we reach the close of the
chapter we find these ten kings all turned against the woman: so
that, instead of being ridden and governed by her, as they were
when she was riding on the beast, they are now turned against
her, and agree in consuming her.&nbsp; &lsquo;The ten horns <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>which thou
sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and make her
desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with
fire.&rsquo; (Verse 16.)</p>
<p>Without stopping to look into the detail, which it is
impossible to do in a short lecture, it appears clear that all
these passages agree in predicting a period during which the
Papacy will be consumed before its final fall.&nbsp; This will be
brought about partly by the power of truth, and partly by the
change of mind in the kings.&nbsp; But whatever be the agency,
the result is the same.&nbsp; &lsquo;They will take away his
dominion, to consume, and to destroy unto the end.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And this you mark is the last great process before the coming of
our Blessed Saviour, for the final destruction will be by the
brightness of His coming.</p>
<p>And now comes the question, Has this consuming process
begun?&nbsp; Is it, or is it not, in progress?&nbsp; I know that
some fainthearted people will say, &lsquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; Rome is
making dreadful progress, and must soon <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>triumph.&rsquo;&nbsp; But surely that opinion is
contrary to fact.&nbsp; Surely it may be proved, from the great
facts of European history, not merely that the consumption has
begun but that it has been going on during the last few years
with peculiar and unexampled speed.</p>
<p>Let us look at a few great European facts, not at little
things that happen to fall within our own observation, but at
great facts that are conspicuous before the world.</p>
<p>Rome has always claimed, as she does still, dominion over all
the kingdoms of the world, and she used to exercise it over all
those of Western Christendom.&nbsp; Her claim even went so far
that, by the common consent and advice of his barons, the King of
England once &lsquo;resigned England and Ireland to God, to St.
Peter and St. Paul, to Pope Innocent, and his successors in the
Apostolic chair: and agreed to hold these dominions as feudatory
of the Church of Rome, by the annual payment of one <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>thousand
marks.&rsquo; <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; Imagine any one standing up
amongst the barons of England, and making such a proposal
now!&nbsp; That dominion of the Papacy is taken away, and taken
away, as I believe, for ever.</p>
<p>When the dominion was gone he made concordats, or compacts,
with the different states; in which, with varying conditions, it
was agreed that he should uphold them by his spiritual power, and
they uphold him by the secular arm.&nbsp; It is a most remarkable
fact, that within the last fifteen years almost all of these
concordats have been brought abruptly to a violent end: those
with Naples, Tuscany, and the Italian Duchies in 1858; that with
Austria, including Venice, in 1866; with Spain in 1868; with
France in 1870; and with Bavaria in 1873.&nbsp; There may be
others remaining in force, but I know of none.&nbsp; According to
the best information I can obtain all are dissolved.&nbsp; The
Papacy has lost all its political power.&nbsp; The ten kings have
shaken <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>off
his government, and there is not one left that submits to his
authority.</p>
<p>But more than that.&nbsp; The Pope of Rome used to be king
over a considerable portion of Italy.&nbsp; But he is now
deposed.&nbsp; The States of the Church are incorporated with
united Italy, and the Pope is king no more.&nbsp; They have taken
away his dominion.&nbsp; His sovereignty is at an end; it has
received its death-blow, and shall we not acknowledge that the
consuming process is begun?</p>
<p>But further still.&nbsp; The Church of Rome used to have vast
estates.&nbsp; The convents which used to swarm through Italy
were richly endowed with landed property.&nbsp; But as soon as
the kingdom of Italy was well established, those convents were
broken up and their property confiscated.&nbsp; And now that the
Pope has been dethroned in Rome, a similar measure has been
passed for all those within the city, and on the 20th of October,
1874, they received notice of their dissolution.&nbsp; It looks
very much as if the <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>kings were eating up the flesh of the woman.</p>
<p>But some will say, &lsquo;Ah, but in religious matters Popery
is making progress, for it is winning so many perverts to its
errors.&rsquo;&nbsp; I know there are perverts, and I am deeply
grieved at it, but I doubt whether Rome&rsquo;s progress is as
great as many think.&nbsp; It has been calculated that in the
year 1801 there were in Great Britain and Ireland twenty-seven
Romanists out of every hundred of the population, but that in
1869 there were only eighteen.&nbsp; The proportion, therefore,
had actually diminished from twenty-seven to eighteen per cent.
<a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>But take a wider range, and look at the great facts of
European history.&nbsp; At the Lateran Council in 1513, after all
the so-called heretics had been silenced or burned, <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>it was
proclaimed, &lsquo;No one now opposes, no one now objects,&rsquo;
and then the orator addressing the Pope said, &lsquo;The whole
body of Christendom is now subjugated to one head, even to
thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it is calculated that there are now more
than 95,000,000 Protestants in Europe, and 67,000,000 members of
the Greek Church, making together 162,000,000 who reject the
Pope&rsquo;s authority, against 157,000,000 who profess to submit
to it.&nbsp; Putting all these facts together, I may ask any
reasonable man, any one who looks at great facts instead of
minute details, Is there not reason to believe that the
consumption has begun?&nbsp; What else is it that has taken away
his dominions, broken up his concordats, overturned his throne,
stripped him of his property, and above all has set 95,000,000 in
Europe alone free from his yoke?&nbsp; What else is it but the
fulfilment of the prophecy, &lsquo;Whom the Lord shall consume
with the Spirit of His mouth,&rsquo; preparatory to the time when
He shall <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>&lsquo;destroy him with the brightness of His
coming?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now there are many lessons that we might learn if we had but
time from this subject; <i>e.g.</i>, I might well spend all the
time that remains in pressing on you the importance of keeping
clear of all alliance with Rome.&nbsp; If God is consuming her,
God&rsquo;s people must have nothing to do with her either in
politics or religion, for if they do, they will find themselves
drawn into the vortex into which she must infallibly sink.&nbsp;
The message to them is, &lsquo;Come out of her, my people, that
ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
plagues.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this is not my point in this lecture.&nbsp; I am anxious
rather that we should look on the whole subject as an
encouragement to faith.&nbsp; Surely some amongst us are too
fainthearted about the truth.&nbsp; It really seems as if they
could trust the Lord Jesus for their own souls, but not for His
church, or for His truth: as if they had forgotten <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the text,
&lsquo;Are not thine eyes upon the truth?&rsquo;&nbsp; They value
their Bible, and are ready to contend for it even unto the death;
but still, they do not above half believe it.&nbsp; They are
ready to go forth to battle, but they are not ready to begin,
like Jehoshaphat, with the hymn, &lsquo;Praise the
Lord!&rsquo;&nbsp; They would rather chant some plaintive lament,
and go into the battle with the doleful expectation of
defeat.&nbsp; But this is not faith.&nbsp; This is not trust in
the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; Ah! but one says he cannot rely on
government, and another that he does not trust in bishops.&nbsp;
But what has this to do with it?&nbsp; No one asks you to trust
in rulers either in Church or State, for the Scripture says,
&lsquo;Put not your trust in princes.&rsquo;&nbsp; What we ask
you to do is to trust the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of
God.&nbsp; Trust Him, and all will be right, though all other
objects of trust fail you.</p>
<p>Now take this great subject as a help to your trust.&nbsp; See
how it exhibits Him in His <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>own time and His own way, working out
His own predicted purpose.&nbsp; It was utterly impossible for
any man by private interpretation to calculate the course that
things would take.&nbsp; But He foresaw all, and more than two
thousand years ago He actually foretold what He would do.&nbsp;
And now, after all these centuries have passed, after great
empires have risen and fallen according to His prophecy, after
every species of effort has been made in vain to silence
God&rsquo;s Word, after every available means have been
employed&mdash;political influence, religious influence, priestly
assumption, and fiery persecution&mdash;to stamp out God&rsquo;s
truth, we see the Lord Jesus with a mighty hand fulfilling His
word, carrying out His purpose, and preparing the way for
victory.&nbsp; And is that the time to distrust Him?&nbsp; If we
are so fainthearted now what should we have been before the
Reformation?&nbsp; What should we have been after John Huss was
burned, and when the Lord&rsquo;s own people were like the seven
thousand hidden ones <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>in the days of Elijah?&nbsp; If we
cannot trust Him now that we have experienced that &lsquo;His
counsels of old are faithfulness and truth,&rsquo; what should we
have done if we had lived before any prophecies had been
fulfilled; if we had had to trust to His bare naked word before
it was confirmed by history?&nbsp; But now that we have this
great confirmation, and now that we see the putting forth of His
hand, this is not the time for faintheartedness or misgiving;
this is not the time to distrust Him whom God has made the
&lsquo;Head over all things to His Church.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
true that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;God moves in a mysterious way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wonders to perform;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it is certain that He is riding on the storm and will
perform His own wonders, so that we may add, as in the next verse
of the same hymn,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cloud ye so much dread<br />
Is big with mercies, and will break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In blessings on your head.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>And not
only so, but we may reverently hope that it will not be long
before we behold His triumph.&nbsp; When the disciples were on
the lake the night was dark, and the winds were contrary, but He
came to them in His own good time, and all was rest.&nbsp; So we
may meet with rough weather, but there will be a great calm when
He comes, and I cannot but hope He will soon be here.&nbsp; We
have long since known of Him on the mountain-top, but now we can
almost see Him walking on the waves.&nbsp; It is high time,
therefore, that we act on His own words: &lsquo;When these things
begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for
your redemption draweth nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; He does not say,
&lsquo;Wait till they have all come to pass,&rsquo; but
&lsquo;look up as soon as they begin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now they most
undoubtedly have begun, and for a long time have been in
progress.&nbsp; It is high time, therefore, that we begin to look
up in faith and hope, waiting for Christ, looking for Christ,
longing for Christ, and meanwhile trusting in Christ; <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>so that when
He comes we may be found pardoned through His blood, accepted in
His covenant, clothed in His righteousness, and with loving
hearts waiting for His appearing.</p>
<h2><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>TURKEY.</h2>
<h3>III.<br />
THE EUPHRATES.</h3>
<p>The condition of the Turkish Empire is one of the greatest
interests of the day, and is engaging more than any other public
subject the grave thoughts of thinking men.&nbsp; The capitalists
of England are deploring the loss of many millions of money
through its bankruptcy.&nbsp; Those who rejoice in religious
liberty are watching with the deepest interest the noble
struggles of the men of Herzegovina to free themselves from the
fearful yoke of Mohammedan oppression.&nbsp; And the politicians
of all the great states of Europe are at their wits&rsquo; end to
know what is to become of Turkey.&nbsp; Nor is this a state of
things that has come on suddenly.&nbsp; <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>It is not the
transitory effect of any sudden calamity, but the result of a
steady decay that has been going forward with irresistible power
for certainly not less than fifty years.&nbsp; France and England
combined in the Crimean war to endeavour to maintain the Turkish
power, but it was all in vain.&nbsp; That power has been steadily
on the wane ever since, till now the crisis of bankruptcy has
arrived, and &lsquo;the Sick Man,&rsquo; as the Turkish empire
has been called, appears on the very point of his dissolution. <a
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a></p>
<p>Now I am quite aware of the difficulty of preaching on such
subjects, and I have no doubt that in your mind as well as my own
there is a preference for those portions <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>of the Word
of God which bear directly on our spiritual experience; but still
&lsquo;all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness&rsquo;; and, moreover, there is a
special blessing on the congregational study of this Revelation
of St. John, for it is said, chap. i. 3, &lsquo;Blessed is he
that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
prophecy.&rsquo;&nbsp; I propose, therefore, to consider three
questions: (1.) Has the present state of Turkey been foretold in
prophecy?&nbsp; (2.) Does it teach us any lessons respecting our
spiritual position?&nbsp; (3.) Does it throw any light on our
hope of the coming of our Lord?&nbsp; I pray God that He may
fulfil to us the promise attached to this wonderful book, and
that both they that hear and he that readeth may alike enjoy His
blessing.</p>
<p>With reference to the first question&mdash;Has the present
state of Turkey been foretold in prophecy?&nbsp; I have not the
least hesitation in expressing my own conviction <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>that it has
been foretold in a most remarkable manner, and that the present
state of things is nothing more than the fulfilment of what God
predicted little less than 1800 years ago.</p>
<p>It is impossible in a short lecture to give all the reasons
for this opinion.&nbsp; I can only attempt the barest
outline.&nbsp; But we may gain some idea of the subject if we
consider what is meant by the Euphrates; what by its overflow;
and what by its drying up, as described in Rev. xvi. 12:
&lsquo;And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great
river Euphrates, and the waters thereof were dried up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The Euphrates.&nbsp; By this we must not understand
the literal river, for the whole book is symbolical.&nbsp; The
river, therefore, stands as the symbol for something else.&nbsp;
It is this that makes the subject so difficult, for the symbols
are like hieroglyphics, and therefore, though full of meaning,
peculiarly liable to be misunderstood.&nbsp; The question then
is, What is the power of which the <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Euphrates in this verse stands as a
symbol or hieroglyphic?&nbsp; Of course, in the answer to such a
question we must distrust ourselves, and I dare not speak on it
with the certainty with which we ought to speak of the plainly
revealed facts of Scripture.&nbsp; All I can do is to express my
own very confident conviction that by the Euphrates is symbolized
the Ottoman, or, as it is frequently called, the Turkish
Empire.</p>
<p>For this I give two reasons:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It is the one great empire existing in the world
that originated on the banks of the river Euphrates.&nbsp; It was
in the district to the east of that river that the Turk, who
originally came from Turkistan, became a formidable power, and
from thence that the Turkish hosts were let loose against Roman
Christendom.&nbsp; For we must remember that the Turks, or
Ottomans, do not belong to the soil of Turkey.&nbsp; The French
are the natives of France, and the Italians of Italy, but the
Turks are not the natives of Turkey, but invaders from <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Asia.&nbsp;
They hold the country by conquest.&nbsp; The head-quarters of the
empire are now in Turkey, on the shores of the Bosphorus; but its
birthplace was on the Eastern bank of the Euphrates.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; There are two series of prophecies in the book of
Revelation, the one given under the figure of seven trumpets, the
other of seven vials, and they appear to be linked together by a
very remarkable connexion as to the subject of the
prophecies.&nbsp; You will see the correspondence clearly if you
compare the account of the trumpets in chapters viii. and ix.
with that of the vials in chapter xvi.</p>
<p>When the first trumpet sounded the judgment was on the earth,
viii. 7; and so the first vial was poured on the earth, xvi.
2.</p>
<p>When the second trumpet sounded, the judgment was on the sea,
chap. viii. 8.&nbsp; So the second vial was poured on the sea,
xvi. 3.</p>
<p>When the third trumpet sounded, the judgment was on the rivers
and fountains <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>of waters, viii. 10.&nbsp; So the third angel poured out
his vial on the rivers and fountains of waters, xvi. 4.</p>
<p>When the fourth trumpet sounded, the judgment was on the sun,
viii. 12.&nbsp; So the fourth angel poured out his vial on the
sun, xvi. 8.</p>
<p>When the fifth trumpet sounded, the judgment was on those men
who had not the seal of God on their foreheads, ix. 4.&nbsp; So
the fifth vial was on the seat of the beast, xvi. 10.</p>
<p>The correspondence is not at first sight so apparent in this
as in the other vials; but if we bear in mind the prophecy that
all shall worship the beast whose names are not written in the
book of life, we shall see the same reality in the
coincidence.</p>
<p>And, lastly, when the sixth trumpet sounded, there was a
mighty host loosed from the Euphrates, ix. 14; and when the sixth
vial was poured out it fell on the Euphrates, and the Euphrates
was dried up, xvi. 12.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Surely,
then, we may come to the conclusion that this prophecy in chapter
xvi. relates to the same great power as that referred to in
chapter ix.; and as I believe that it has been proved that the
trumpet prophecy predicts the invasion of Christendom by the
Ottoman empire, so I am persuaded in my own mind that that under
the vial foretells its exhaustion and decay.&nbsp; The Ottoman
empire I believe to be the subject of both the prophecies.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The overflow.&nbsp; There is no actual mention in
this passage of the symbol of an overflow, but as that figure is
elsewhere employed in Holy Scripture to represent invasion, we
may regard it in this instance as descriptive of the invasion by
the Ottomans as predicted under the sixth trumpet.&nbsp; If you
turn to Jer. xlvi. 7, 8, you find an invasion by Egypt described
by an exactly similar figure.&nbsp; The invasion by Egypt is
there compared to an overflow of the Nile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Egypt
cometh up like a flood, and his waters are moved as the
rivers.&rsquo;&nbsp; So in <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Isa. viii. 7, 8, the invasion of
Palestine by the Assyrians is foretold under the figure of an
inundation: &lsquo;He shall come up over all his channels, and go
over all his banks: and he shall pass through Judah; he shall
overflow and go over.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so here the invasion by
the Ottoman or Euphratian horsemen appears to be represented by
an overflow of the Euphrates.</p>
<p>Now consider the result of the recent floods in our own
country.&nbsp; When the Trent rose above its banks, what
happened?&nbsp; The waters spread far and wide on both sides the
river, till, instead of fields and homesteads, you saw a vast
inland lake.&nbsp; As you passed by in the train you might have
seen the whole country under water.&nbsp; Just so it was when,
according to the symbol, the Euphrates overflowed its banks; or,
according to history, the Ottomans invaded Europe.&nbsp; The
invading waters rushed on in every direction.&nbsp; On the east
they reached the borders of China; on the west they soon reached
Palestine, and all the <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>heroic efforts of the Crusaders
failed to check them.&nbsp; They then spread out in two
branches.&nbsp; On the south they crossed into Africa, and spread
over the greater part of the northern portion of that vast
continent.&nbsp; In the north they spread rapidly over Asia
Minor, crossed the Bosphorus, conquered Greece, and spread over
Europe till they reached the shores of the Adriatic, and even
Venice. <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; Thus when they had reached the
height of their power, the whole of south-east Europe, the
greater part of north Africa, and the whole of west Asia, were
flooded by the vast inundation.&nbsp; Their dominion extended
from the shores of the Adriatic on the west to the borders of
China on the east; while in Africa it reached very nearly from
the Atlantic to Suez.&nbsp; Accordingly we have been taught from
our childhood of Turkey in Europe, Turkey in Asia, and Turkey in
Africa.&nbsp; But I am not sure that we are all aware that the
Turks, or Ottomans, are Asiatic invaders <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>who obtained
their dominions by conquest.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; So much for the overflow.&nbsp; Let us now turn to
the drying up, as predicted in the prophecy.</p>
<p>Think once more of the illustration of the river, and consider
what would be the effect on the overflow if the waters were to
subside in the river.&nbsp; The inundation would gradually
recede, and one field after another would be left dry, until
after a time the whole country would be free.&nbsp; If,
therefore, the interpretation of the prophecy be correct, we
should expect to see the Ottoman power gradually dying out, and
the various nations that were overrun by conquest one by one
shaking off the yoke.&nbsp; And this is exactly what has been
taking place ever since the year 1820.&nbsp; There is a
remarkable prophecy in Daniel believed to refer to this same
Ottoman power, and from it some of the best students of prophecy
in the course of the last century named that year as the probable
commencement of the decline of Turkey.&nbsp; Up to the spring of
the year all <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>appeared to prosper; but then the waters began rapidly
to recede.&nbsp; That very year the Greek insurrection
began.&nbsp; The flood receded from Greece, so that in 1827 the
present kingdom was established.&nbsp; In that same year the
inundation went back so far that Servia was left dry.&nbsp; In
the same year Moldavia and Wallachia, and the territory north of
the Danube, were set free from the Ottoman yoke; and now there
seems to be every hope that Herzegovina and Bosnia will succeed
in shaking off the invader.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole Turkish
empire is in such a condition that if the statesmen of Europe
could agree as to who should possess Constantinople, the whole
Ottoman Power would in all probability be driven out of Europe
before another year is over. <a name="citation47"></a><a
href="#footnote47" class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>As for
Africa, the flood has already left it almost dry.&nbsp; Morocco
is an independent state.&nbsp; Algeria has been taken by the
French, while on the east, Egypt has asserted its independence,
and with the one exception of an annual tribute, is entirely free
from the Turkish yoke.&nbsp; For some years this process had been
going on, till at length, in 1866, the Pasha assumed the title of
&lsquo;Khedive,&rsquo; which means king, proclaiming thereby an
independent monarchy.&nbsp; The only possession remaining to
Turkey is the little province of Tripoli, containing considerably
less than 1,000,000 inhabitants.&nbsp; Turkey in Africa has
almost ceased to exist. <a name="citation48"></a><a
href="#footnote48" class="citation">[48]</a>&nbsp; Turkey in
Europe may last a little longer, but is going fast.&nbsp; As for
Turkey in Asia, it has ceased to be a power <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>to any great
distance east of the Euphrates; and I fully believe that on the
west of the river the drying-up process will be steadily
continued till the floods recede from Palestine, and that
beautiful land shall be set free from the blight of Turkish
misgovernment, and handed over to be once more a land flowing
with milk and honey to its rightful possessors, the seed of
Abraham, the nation to which God has given it.</p>
<p>Such are a few of the leading events with reference to the
decline of the Ottoman empire; and there is only one further
remark that I would make respecting it.&nbsp; The decline has not
been the result of external conquest, but of internal
decay.&nbsp; The Turks have not been brought down by any great
defeats, but by their own want of life.&nbsp; The powers of
Europe have not attacked them, but, on the contrary, have done
their best to uphold them, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the Crimean war;
but, notwithstanding all that France and England could do, the
Turkish power is falling to pieces of itself.&nbsp; The Sick Man
is <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>dying,
and the physicians cannot keep him alive.&nbsp; Their energy
seems gone, their exchequer is exhausted, and their population is
so much diminished, that there are now only 2,000,000 Turks, or
Ottomans, left in Europe. <a name="citation50"></a><a
href="#footnote50" class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; In other
words, the Euphrates is drying up, and the inundation cannot long
remain upon the land.</p>
<p>Now I can quite understand the feeling of those who have
experienced a certain amount of disappointment in hearing this
morning about the Turkish empire, instead of something bearing
more directly on their own personal salvation, and I should
myself have preferred to have preached on some such
subject.&nbsp; But I have taken this subject on principle.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Because, as I have already said, &lsquo;all Scripture
is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>No portion, therefore, of God&rsquo;s
word, whether it be prophetic or historical, ought to be set
aside by those who really desire to know God&rsquo;s truth.&nbsp;
If we wish to know the whole mind of God we must be prepared to
study the whole of the Holy Scriptures which God has given
us.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But, besides that, we must remember that our whole
faith depends on Holy Scripture.&nbsp; All that we know of the
Lord Jesus Christ, of His great high-priesthood, of His atoning
blood, of His free salvation, of the gift of the Holy Ghost, of
the new birth, and of the coming Advent, all our hope for the
future, and all our rest for the present, depend simply and
entirely on the Word of God.&nbsp; In it we find all; without it
we have nothing.&nbsp; When, therefore, we see a great prophecy
of Holy Scripture fulfilled in our own day, within reach of our
own observation, traceable on our own maps, and included within
the range of our own memory, we ought not to pass it by, but
should accept it with thankfulness <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>in these days of rebuke and
infidelity, as a most blessed confirmation of our faith.&nbsp;
Let any one who has the slightest doubt as to the inspiration of
Scripture look at the facts.&nbsp; Two thousand four hundred
years ago there was a prophet, the prophet Daniel, by the river
of Ulai, and he foresaw in a vision the rise and progress of a
mighty power, telling us at the same time how long it was likely
to continue.&nbsp; Six hundred years after him there arose
another prophet, who described what appears to be the same power,
and gave a graphic picture both of its progress and decay.&nbsp;
Students of Holy Scripture have since been diligently occupied in
the study of these two prophecies; and by comparing Scripture
with Scripture were long since brought to the conclusion that in
the course of this century the decline of the Ottoman Empire
would take place.&nbsp; And now we see it going on.&nbsp; Just
when the students thought it would begin, then it began, and just
as the prophet described <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>its decay, so it is decaying.&nbsp;
The prophets themselves could have known nothing about it when
they prophesied, for the empire did not arise till many centuries
after they had foretold its fall.&nbsp; But God knew all, and a
thousand years were to Him as one day.&nbsp; These prophecies,
therefore, did not arise from any private interpretation or human
calculation of probabilities, but &lsquo;holy men of God spake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now what should be the result on our minds?&nbsp; What effect
should such facts have on ourselves?&nbsp; Should they not
strengthen faith and confirm us in a simple, childlike,
unquestioning trust in the inspired word of the living God?&nbsp;
Who but God Himself could have foretold either to Daniel or John
the rise and decay of the Ottoman Empire?&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s
own word, then, with which we are dealing when we study Holy
Scripture.&nbsp; There may be things in it completely beyond all
power of human calculation, as the history of the <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Ottoman
Empire was utterly beyond the human calculation of either Daniel
or John.&nbsp; But God&rsquo;s truth does not depend on our power
of calculation.&nbsp; It is beyond us altogether, infinite,
eternal, divine; and our part is, whether we can fit it together
or not, to receive the whole as God has given it, and as weak,
ignorant, short-lived, and short-sighted creatures, to receive
His will as He has revealed it, into our hands, and hearts, and
say, &lsquo;I believe God, that it shall be as it was said unto
me.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>IV.<br

THE FROGS.</h3>
<p>In opening our subject in the last lecture, I said that there
were three questions to be considered: 1.&nbsp; Has the present
state of Turkey been foretold in prophecy?&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Does it
teach us any lessons respecting our spiritual position? and
3.&nbsp; Does it throw any light on the blessed hope of our
Lord&rsquo;s return?&nbsp; The first of these questions we
examined in the last lecture, and surely it was proved that in
the symbol of the drying up of the Euphrates we have a most
remarkable symbolic prophecy of the exhaustion of the Ottoman
power.&nbsp; To-day we are to pass on to the second question: Is
our own spiritual position affected by the exhaustion of Turkish
power?&nbsp; Now I can quite understand the thought that <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>has no doubt
occurred to many of you, that the two things can have no possible
connexion with each other, for there seems to our mind to be no
possible connexion of even the most remote character between the
Turkish Empire and our own spiritual life.&nbsp; We may well say,
&lsquo;What have we to do with the Turks, or the Turks with us in
our own daily, private walk with God?&rsquo;&nbsp; It may
surprise some of you when I say that, although no man can explain
the reason of the connexion, I believe it to be very intimate,
and that the religious life of modern Christendom is in a most
remarkable manner bound up with the decline of the Turkish
Empire.</p>
<p>To understand this we must remember that the great prophecy in
the book of Revelation is arranged in periods.&nbsp; Each seal,
each trumpet, and each vial, represents a period.&nbsp; So there
is one particular period of history foretold under the figure of
the sixth vial, and all the events predicted under that vial we
should expect to <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>appear at about the same time in history.&nbsp; Whether
we can trace any connexion or not, the events of each vial are
linked together in respect of time; so that if there are two
events under any one vial, when we see the one we ought to look
out for the other, and when one takes place we have every reason
to believe that the other is at hand.&nbsp; Now there are two
events, apparently quite distinct in themselves, which are thus
connected with each other under the sixth vial&mdash;the drying
up of the Euphrates, and the appearance of certain most dangerous
and seductive spirits, going forth to gather men together for the
battle of Almighty God.&nbsp; If, therefore, it be a fact, as I
firmly believe it to be a fact, that the Euphrates is now being
dried up, then it follows as a sure and certain consequence that
the unclean spirits are soon, if not already, going forth to do
their deadly work.&nbsp; The two things go on according to the
prophecy within the same prophetic period, and therefore if we
see the one, as believers in the <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>word of God, we ought to be on the
lookout for the other.&nbsp; We are thus brought to the
conclusion, that whenever the Euphrates shall be drying up, there
will be a time of great spiritual seduction; or in other words
that the exhaustion of the Turkish Empire will be accompanied, or
quickly followed, by a remarkable development of mischievous
spiritual power.&nbsp; This, then, must be our subject in this
lecture, and we will study (if God permit) first the danger, and
then the caution.&nbsp; May God grant that the result may be that
we may be like those few men of Sardis who had not defiled their
garments, and who will walk with the Lord Jesus in white, for
they are worthy!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The danger.</p>
<p>This is described in Rev. xvi. 13, 14.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I saw
three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the
dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth
of the false prophet.&nbsp; For they are the spirits of devils
working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and
of the whole <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>world, to gather them to the battle of the great day of
God Almighty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All students of prophecy are well aware how much has been
written in exposition of these two verses, and what different
explanations have been given of these three seductive
spirits.&nbsp; I have not time this morning to discuss any of
them, but there are three things perfectly clear, and it will be
sufficient for us to study them.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The subtlety of the danger.</p>
<p>The passage does not describe three empires, or three
churches, or three great societies, or three organizations of any
kind whatever, but three spirits.&nbsp; Now a spirit is something
subtle and unseen.&nbsp; Its presence is not perceived; its voice
is not heard; its touch is not felt.&nbsp; It comes and goes, but
it leaves no footsteps in the sand.&nbsp; It seems, therefore, a
great mistake to explain this prophecy by different systems that
are conspicuous to the eye, and we must be careful lest, by so
doing, we should be thrown off our guard with reference to <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>our real
danger.&nbsp; There may be no false system presented to us, and
we may be perfectly safe with reference to any definite form of
evil, such as infidelity or popery, but there may be any one, or
indeed all three, of these deadly spirits imperceptibly breathing
poison into our souls.&nbsp; It is this subtlety of spiritual
action that makes it so pre-eminently dangerous.&nbsp; If it were
all open and before the eye we should know how to avoid it.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The variety.</p>
<p>There is not one spirit only, but there are three acting
together.&nbsp; We are taught, therefore, that at the time of the
drying up of the Euphrates we must be prepared for subtle and
seductive power of various forms and characters.&nbsp; If there
were only one spirit the danger might assume only one form: but
as there are three spirits acting together we should be on our
guard against every possible combination.&nbsp; We are not merely
to look out for three distinct and separate forms of error, but,
as all three act <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>together, they may combine in every conceivable
variety.&nbsp; One may act on one mind, two on another, and all
three on a third, and so produce the most remarkable and
inconsistent combinations.&nbsp; Suppose, <i>e.g.</i>, that the
first was Infidelity, the second Worldliness, and the third
Popery.&nbsp; Remember, I do not say that they are, but suppose
they were.&nbsp; In some cases you might have avowed Atheism; in
some, a life so absorbed in the world that a man does not even
take the trouble to be an infidel; and in others pure and
unadulterated Romanism.&nbsp; But, besides that, you might find
every possible combination.&nbsp; Sceptical opinions might be
combined with Romish ritual, and high ceremonial with worldliness
of life.&nbsp; Indeed, there is scarcely any form of seductive
error that you might not develop by combining in different
proportions those three most dangerous spirits.&nbsp; Thus it
follows that, though a person may be well on his guard against
one, he may be gradually entangled by the other two; <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and though he
may be on the watch against all in their distinct and separate
forms, he may be drawn out of a straight path by a beautiful
combination of the three, in which according to St. Paul&rsquo;s
illustration, Satan has transformed himself into an angel of
light.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; The result of the action of these spirits in
conflict.&nbsp; Verse 14&mdash;&lsquo;For they are the spirits of
devils working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the
earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the
great day of God Almighty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their special object appears to be to gather together the
kings to the battle of the great day of God Almighty: and in
studying the prophecy it is impossible to forget the political
difficulties that have already arisen from the decline of
Turkey.&nbsp; But we must not limit the prophecy to kings, for
the warning voice of verse 15 clearly applies to us all.&nbsp;
Kings are not the only persons who find it necessary to watch and
keep their garments.&nbsp; These spirits <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>then, are
predicted as gathering men together for battle.&nbsp; When they
are abroad, truth and error will be thrown into antagonism.&nbsp;
The Lord Jesus Christ will be collecting His forces, and Satan
his: there will be on both sides the mustering of the host.&nbsp;
Those that are on the side of the Lamb will rally round His
banner, &lsquo;called, and chosen, and faithful&rsquo;; and those
that are under the influence of any of the seductive spirits will
throw themselves into the ranks of open opposition.&nbsp; The
characteristic of the day will be, not sloth or indifference, but
zeal, eagerness, and conflict.</p>
<p>Now no one can have watched the progress of men&rsquo;s minds
during the last half century without observing that this has been
most remarkably the case.&nbsp; There cannot be a doubt as to the
fact that, while the Turkish power has been declining, the powers
of good and evil throughout Christendom have been awakening into
life.&nbsp; The two processes have gone on side by side.&nbsp;
Turkey has been drying up, and almost <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>every state in Europe has been
aroused to religious conflict.&nbsp; Many amongst us have been
able to trace the vast change that has taken place during our own
lifetimes.&nbsp; I can see myself an immense difference between
the state of things when I first commenced my ministry, forty
years ago, and the state of things now.&nbsp; Then the
characteristic of the day was stagnation, but now it is
conflict.&nbsp; Then our warfare was against cold, dull, dead,
stolid indifference; but now error in every shape is in full
activity, and we require to be armed at all points against every
species of attack.&nbsp; Then all that unconverted men desired
was to be left undisturbed in the deep sleep that had settled
down on their souls.&nbsp; But they are all awake now, and the
cry is, &lsquo;To arms!&rsquo;&nbsp; Many, alas! are on the wrong
side.&nbsp; Far too many have fallen under the fatal influence of
these seducing spirits; but, whether on the wrong side or the
right, they are awake.&nbsp; They are up and hurrying to their
post.&nbsp; The time for sleep is <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>over; the bugle has sounded, the
ranks are forming, the struggle has begun, and the time is come
when those who know their Saviour must be prepared to stand with
a holy decision on His side.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; And now you can see the overwhelming importance of
the warning of this verse: &lsquo;Blessed is he that watcheth and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
shame.&rsquo;&nbsp; You can see that the exhaustion of Turkey is
a conspicuous signal from God to arouse all Christendom to
watchfulness.&nbsp; We cannot see the three unclean spirits
coming forth, but we can see Turkey decaying; and that is
God&rsquo;s visible signal that the invisible spirits are at
work.&nbsp; If ever, therefore, there was a time for especial
watchfulness it is now.&nbsp; If ever there was a time when our
young people require to be cautioned, and warned, and helped, and
guided, it is now.&nbsp; And you will observe that the warning is
given to those who have some garments.&nbsp; It is not spoken to
the heathen, or unconverted <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>worldlings; but to those who have,
what I may term, some sort of Christian clothing.&nbsp; I have
not time to discuss what that clothing is.&nbsp; It may be their
baptismal robe, that which they put on when they were baptized
into Christ.&nbsp; It may be the robe of their Christian
profession, that which they wear habitually in daily life; or it
may even be that spotless robe washed white in the blood of the
Lamb, in which alone they can stand before God, the wedding
garment of the perfect righteousness of the Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; In whatever sense we understand the expression, the
solemn and sacred warning from God to every one of us, both old
and young, is the same; viz., that we watch and keep our
garments, lest we walk naked, and they see our shame.&nbsp; We
see the Euphrates drying up, and therefore we know that the evil
spirits are abroad.&nbsp; We know, <i>i.e.</i>, that there are
subtle, deadly influences all around us, of various kinds and
characters, whose object is to draw us away from the simplicity
that is in Christ, to strip <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>us of our garments, and to enlist us
on the wrong side of the struggle.&nbsp; We may not be aware of
their stealthy approach; and we are not likely to be so, for we
are certain not to see them.&nbsp; We need not necessarily be
shocked by their suggestions, for, though they be unclean
spirits, they can clothe their temptation in the form of
beauty.&nbsp; But whether we detect them or not, we may be sure
they are at work, and in full activity.&nbsp; They are moving
with stealthy steps in the midst of us.&nbsp; They are
approaching our minds in secret, disturbing prayer, suggesting
doubts, weakening faith, poisoning thought, alienating love, and
so labouring by subtle, mental influence, to detach us from
Christ.&nbsp; And only think what the result would be if they
were to succeed; nothing less than this, that we should walk
naked and they would see our shame!&nbsp; It is not clear who is
meant by the &lsquo;they&rsquo; that are to see the shame.&nbsp;
It may be the world at large, or it may be the very spirits that
have done the mischief, looking <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>on with a fiendish smile on the
misery and nakedness of the poor wretch whom they have
ruined.&nbsp; But it matters not who sees it; that will make very
little difference.&nbsp; To be naked before God, that is
enough.&nbsp; He is sure to see it, and the dreadful horrors of
such a position far exceed any power of human imagination.&nbsp;
You remember how St. Paul spoke of it in 2 Cor. v. 3: &lsquo;If
so be that being clothed&rsquo; (clothed, <i>i.e.</i>, with the
resurrection body) &lsquo;we shall not be found
naked.&rsquo;&nbsp; Clothed, but yet naked.&nbsp; Risen, but not
covered.&nbsp; Alive with all the realities of the body, and all
the faculties of the mind, memory, and conscience; but with the
poor soul naked, without a claim, without an excuse, without an
atonement, without a plea, without a Saviour, without any hope
for all eternity of either concealment or forgiveness.&nbsp; The
thought is too dreadful to be borne.&nbsp; Oh, may God in mercy
grant that not one of us, and not one whom we love, may be found
naked in that day?&nbsp; And oh! what an inexpressible joy it is
for <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>the
child of God, however weak, however unworthy, however unable to
cope with all the seductions of those wicked spirits, to fall
back on the sure promise of his blessed Saviour: &lsquo;They
shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My
hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; He can keep us, and we may be sure He
will.&nbsp; Let us throw ourselves then into His hand to be
clothed, to be kept, to be watched over, to be held fast, that
so, preserved in Christ Jesus, and clothed in His spotless robe,
we may never be found naked, but may when He comes be presented
&lsquo;faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding
joy.&rsquo; <a name="citation69"></a><a href="#footnote69"

<h3><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>V.<br
/>
THE ADVENT.</h3>
<p>I trust there are many amongst us who are able to say, from
the very depths of their longing hearts, &lsquo;I wait for the
Lord, my soul doth wait.&rsquo;&nbsp; The long-expected coming of
the Lord is the blessed hope on which their hearts rest in eager
and earnest expectation, and they can add their unqualified
&lsquo;Amen&rsquo; to the last prayer of Scripture, &lsquo;Even
so, come, Lord Jesus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am persuaded that all those who are thus looking for the
coming of the Lord must feel the greatest possible interest in
the last of the three subjects proposed for our consideration
with reference to the exhaustion of the Turkish Empire, as
symbolized by the drying up of the Euphrates.&nbsp; We have seen
that the exhaustion which is <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>now attracting the anxious attention
of all the politicians of Europe was foretold more than eighteen
hundred years ago in this remarkable symbolic prophecy.&nbsp; We
found also in the last lecture that the internal decay of Turkey
is a warning to us all to be on the watch against the seductive
spirits of the latter days; and we now have to examine whether
there is any connexion between that decay and the glorious advent
of the Lord Jesus; whether, in other words, the decline of the
Ottoman empire is not like the cry which aroused the ten virgins
in the parable, &lsquo;The Bridegroom cometh.&rsquo;&nbsp; There
are two questions which will clearly require our careful
study.&nbsp; (1.)&nbsp; What light does the decline of the
Ottoman Empire throw on the near approach of our Lord&rsquo;s
return?&nbsp; And (2), if it does throw such a light, how are we
to understand His declaration that He will come as a thief?&nbsp;
May God Himself, who has inspired His own word, be graciously
pleased to direct us in the study of it; and to lead us, every <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>one of us, to
be perfectly ready, waiting for the Lord Jesus!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; What light, then, does the decay of the Ottoman
Empire throw on the prospect of the near approach of our
Lord&rsquo;s return?&nbsp; Has it any bearing on our Christian
hope? and may we regard it as a signal from God that the time is
come when we may soon expect the Advent?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question we must examine:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The position of the prophecy in the general
structure of the Book.&nbsp; The prophecies of this wonderful
book are arranged on a divinely ordered plan.&nbsp; There are
some chapters to which it is difficult to assign their place; but
it is easy to see what may be termed the backbone running through
the whole.&nbsp; To use a very homely illustration, there is the
main line of rail conspicuously running through the whole, and
you may trace that clearly, though you cannot always trace the
branches.&nbsp; Now in <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>this outline there are three great
series of prophetic periods&mdash;the seven seals, the seven
trumpets, and the seven vials; and these three series appear in a
remarkable manner to follow each other.&nbsp; First there are the
seals, as in chap. vi.; and when the sixth seal is opened, and
the seventh about to follow, there appears a general expectation
of the coming of the Lord.&nbsp; But when the seventh seal is
actually opened, instead of our coming to the end, as apparently
was expected, we find a second series developed.&nbsp; The seven
trumpets were wrapped as it were in the seventh seal (viii. 1,
2), so that when it was opened they appeared, and a fresh series
commenced, and the trumpet-angels one after another blew their
blast.&nbsp; At length the seventh trumpet is sounded, and again
it appears as though you had reached the end.&nbsp; But like the
seventh seal, it, too, is found to contain within itself a third
series.&nbsp; The seven vials are wrapped within it, and when
that last trumpet is blown they are poured forth <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>in awful
succession on a wicked world.&nbsp; Thus the seventh seal
contains all the trumpets, and the seventh trumpet all the
vials.&nbsp; Now if this be the case it is clear that the sixth
vial must come very near the end.&nbsp; The trumpets are none
sounded till the six seals are passed and the seventh seal is
opened.&nbsp; The vials do not begin till the six trumpets have
completed their blast and the seventh has sounded; and of the
vials six must have been poured out already, so that there can be
nothing remaining but the seventh, or the last.</p>
<p>To take the very homely illustration of a railway.&nbsp;
Suppose a series of stations on a line, the seventh being a
junction; suppose that on the branch from that junction there was
another series of stations, the seventh again being a junction;
and from that second junction there was another line of seven
stations, the last being your home.&nbsp; What would you think of
your position when you had travelled the whole length of the main
line, and the whole of the first <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>branch, and when you had gone so far
along the second branch that you had actually reached the sixth
station on that last line?&nbsp; You would say, surely, that you
were near the end of your journey, close to home.&nbsp; Now
whenever the Church of God reaches the sixth vial that will be
its position.&nbsp; All the seals will have been opened, all the
trumpets blown, and six of the seven vials poured out.</p>
<p>But that I believe to be our position now, and that we are at
this present time living under the sixth vial.&nbsp; I believe
that the great public, political event of the sixth vial, is the
drying up of the Ottoman Empire, and that we can all see to be in
progress.&nbsp; There can be no doubt about the great, public,
political fact.&nbsp; It is confirmed by every newspaper, and is
forced on the attention of England by the sore distress brought
on many families through the Turkish bankruptcy.&nbsp; But if
this be the fact predicted by the symbol of the drying up of the
Euphrates, then it follows that <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>we are living under the sixth vial,
and that the seventh vial is all that remains of the great
prophetic series.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But consider next the contents of the seventh
vial.&nbsp; The seventh seal contained the series of seven
trumpets, and the seventh trumpet the series of seven
vials.&nbsp; May there not be some similar series wrapped up in
the seventh vial?</p>
<p>Such a question would be perfectly reasonable, but the only
answer that we can give is that we do not find any such series
described in the prophecy.&nbsp; On the other hand, everything in
it looks like the end.&nbsp; When the seventh angel poured out
his vial there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying, &lsquo;It is done!&rsquo;&nbsp; It
certainly did not look like the commencement of another series,
but taught us rather to look out for the great winding up of the
whole and the final close of the great prophetic plan.&nbsp; So
in the account of the seventh vial you may see four things
plainly revealed&mdash;the fall of <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Babylon, which I believe to be the
fall of Rome, chap. xvi. 17, to the end of xviii.; the marriage
supper of the Lamb, chap. xix. 1&ndash;9; the triumphant victory
of the Son of God, chap. xix. 11, 12; and, last of all, the
millennial reign, chap. xx.&nbsp; Surely, then, this vial brings
us to the end.&nbsp; Surely when it is poured forth we shall have
done with the politics of the world, and shall cease to look for
the gradual development of history.&nbsp; All thoughts will then
be occupied by the unspeakable blessedness of the marriage supper
of the Lamb.</p>
<p>It seems clear, then, that the seventh vial is the close of
the series, and that under it we are to expect the final victory
of the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The conclusion, therefore, is
plain, that if the exhaustion of the Ottoman Empire is the event
symbolized by the drying up of the Euphrates, it is high time
that we awake out of sleep: for the sixth vial is already begun,
and we must soon expect to behold Christ Himself, with all the
joys of His kingdom and all <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the terrors of a crushing
victory.&nbsp; I say &lsquo;soon,&rsquo; not
&lsquo;immediately,&rsquo; for it does not appear that this
passage teaches us to expect it any day or hour, for it describes
certain great political events which have not yet taken
place.&nbsp; The Euphrates is drying, but not yet dry.&nbsp; The
kings have not yet passed over from the East, and the battle of
Almighty God, whatever it may symbolize, has not yet been
fought.&nbsp; All, therefore, that we can say is, that we appear
to have reached what Daniel terms &lsquo;the time of the
end&rsquo;; that now it is high time to awake out of sleep, for
we already begin to see the first streaks of morning dawn.&nbsp;
We have already witnessed some of the great events that must very
shortly precede the Advent, and we may begin to look out full of
hope for the actual return of the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; This conclusion is confirmed by the words of our
Lord Himself.&nbsp; I need not stop to prove that He is the
speaker in this passage, but we must carefully observe His <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>words.&nbsp;
What does He say when the sixth vial is poured out, and the
Euphrates is drying up, and when the three evil spirits are gone
forth through Christendom?&nbsp; What is the warning voice which
He Himself then gives out with reference to His coming?&nbsp;
What lesson would He have us learn from these great events?&nbsp;
Of what are they His signal?&nbsp; Does He not teach us to be
looking out for His coming?&nbsp; Does He not say, &lsquo;Behold,
I come as a thief?&rsquo; <a name="citation79"></a><a
href="#footnote79" class="citation">[79]</a>&nbsp; Does He not
call us to a double watchfulness, and teach us not merely to
watch against the seductive influence of these foul spirits, but
to watch also for His own appearing, and for the bright hope of
joyfully meeting Him?&nbsp; But if this be the case, and if the
prophecy of the sixth vial is really being now fulfilled, as we
believe it to be, by the drying up of the Turkish power; then
every fresh symptom of decay <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>in that power, every loss of
territory by the Turks, every fresh insurrection, and every proof
that the empire is reduced to hopeless bankruptcy, is like a
clarion blast of the trumpet of God ringing through the ears of
Christendom; and proclaiming, with a distinctness which cannot be
mistaken, &lsquo;Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day
nor the hour when the Son of Man cometh!&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But if this be the case, it behoves us carefully to
examine our second question.&nbsp; If such a warning is so
clearly given, how can He be said to come as a thief?&nbsp; He
Himself teaches us perfectly clearly that the meaning of the
illustration is that, as the thief comes without giving notice,
so He will return without previously giving any such notice of
His approach as will arouse the sleepers.&nbsp; The thief does
not tell you when he is coming; and when he comes, he neither
knocks at the door nor rings the bell.&nbsp; But he comes
quietly.&nbsp; He does nothing to disturb those that are <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>asleep, and
his object is to enter unobserved.&nbsp; So our Lord teaches us,
that when He comes He will do nothing to startle the world.&nbsp;
There will be nothing to prevent men eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, right up to the very end.&nbsp;
The men of the world will find Him in the house before they have
the least idea of His approach.&nbsp; That this is the meaning of
the words is perfectly clear from what He said (Matt. xxiv.
42&ndash;44): &lsquo;Watch, therefore; for ye know not what hour
your Lord doth come.&nbsp; But know this, that if the goodman of
the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would
have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken
up.&nbsp; Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye
think not, the Son of Man cometh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, you may say, how far is this consistent with what has
been said of the probability of His return following quickly on
the exhaustion of the Ottoman Empire?&nbsp; If there be a
prophetic series in the book <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>of Revelation, and we have already
reached the last station on the last branch of the line, how is
it that He can be said to come upon us without notice as a thief
does?&nbsp; Has He not given us notice in this prophecy?</p>
<p>In answer to that question we must observe the clearly marked
distinction between His own believing people and the unbelieving
world.&nbsp; To His own people He will not come as a thief, for
we read in 1 Thess. v. 4, 5, &lsquo;But ye, brethren, are not in
darkness that that day should overtake <i>you</i> as a
thief.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>You</i> are in the light, <i>i.e.</i>, for
you can see Him coming; so <i>you</i> will not be found
asleep.&nbsp; So He Himself taught us distinctly in the very
passage in which He uses the illustration; for He there shows
that His own disciples are to expect His coming when they see the
predicted signs, just as they expect the summer when they see the
budding of the trees in spring (Matt. xxiv. 32, 33).&nbsp; Nor
are they to wait in their expectation till they see these signs
fully developed; not to wait, <i>i.e.</i>, till the <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>young branch
is fully grown; but they are to watch beginnings, and learn from
them.&nbsp; They are to draw their conclusion when the branch is
yet tender, without waiting till it is fully ripened; as He
Himself taught us in Luke, xxi. 28: &lsquo;When these things
<i>begin</i> to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your
heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; If,
therefore, you be amongst the people of God, you need never be
taken by surprise.&nbsp; We do not know the exact time, but we
may study the predicted signs, and, having them before us, may
look out for the second advent just as Simeon and Anna looked out
for the first.&nbsp; We may be like the servant of Elijah, going
up again and again to the hill-top to watch for the coming rain;
or like the loving servant watching for the footsteps of the
master whom he loves, and perfectly ready, whenever he returns,
to open the door, and welcome him to his home.&nbsp; The Lord
came suddenly to His temple, but He did not come suddenly to
Simeon; and the Lord <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>will come as a thief to the world,
but if you hold fast to His own word He will never be as a thief
to you.</p>
<p>As I have already said, it is the <i>world</i> that will be
found asleep, and to whom He will really come as a thief.&nbsp;
But some man may say, &lsquo;If there be these signs beforehand,
will they not arouse the world as well as believers?&nbsp; Will
they not awaken society?&nbsp; Will they not compel men to
prepare?&rsquo;&nbsp; I answer that by another question, Do
they?&nbsp; There are certain signs already given; do they wake
up society?&nbsp; Have they produced such an impression as to
arouse the great mass of worldly men?&nbsp; There are the Jews
preserved as a separate people, in fulfilment of a prophecy given
more than three thousand years ago; what effect has such a
fulfilment of God&rsquo;s word had in the City?&nbsp; There are
all the politicians of Europe at their wits&rsquo; end because of
the decay of Turkey; how many even of yourselves have been led
thereby to look out for the near approach of our blessed <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Saviour?&nbsp; There is Rome stripped of its temporal
power in fulfilment of great prophecies given, some of them, more
than two thousand years ago; how many are there that have been
led by that fulfilment to look out even for the fall of
Babylon?&nbsp; The simple fact is, that these great fulfilments,
though conspicuous to the eye of those who study them, completely
fail to produce the least impression on the deep sleep of the
unconverted world.&nbsp; The prophecies are not read; the facts
are not compared with them; the lessons are not learned; and the
soul is not aroused to preparation.&nbsp; How many are there even
in this very town on whom the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s prophetic
word has never produced the slightest effect?&nbsp; They are
living just as they would have lived, or rather sleeping as they
would have slept, if there had been no prophecy to give the
warning, and no history to confirm its truth.&nbsp; Can you
wonder, then, that the Lord Jesus should come upon such persons
as a thief?</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>But I
trust, dear brethren, that He may not come as a thief to you, but
that you may be found in the light and awake, not in darkness and
asleep; or, to use the illustration of this text, that you may
not wake up naked to your everlasting shame.&nbsp; I am sure you
desire when He comes to be found awake, looking out, ready to
welcome Him.&nbsp; You wish to be found clothed.&nbsp; Oh, think
what it would be to be found naked, when all the saints of God
are standing around you in their resurrection robe!&nbsp; We have
lately read of poor people startled in the night by shipwreck,
and rushing as they were to the deck, utterly unprotected against
the bitter blast of the winter&rsquo;s snow-storm.&nbsp; Think
what it would be to be suddenly aroused from your own deep sleep,
to see all that you have in the world wrecked around you, and to
find your poor soul quite naked, while the terrible storm of
God&rsquo;s most just judgment beats upon you, and breaks down
every hope of escape!&nbsp; Oh, dear brethren, <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>may it never
be so with you!&nbsp; May you be amongst those who can peacefully
look for His appearing, because you are clothed in His
righteousness!&nbsp; May you be kept walking in the light, and
cleansed from all sin through His most precious blood!&nbsp; Then
you will have nothing to fear, but everything to hope for, in the
thought of His coming.&nbsp; Then He will never come as a thief
to you, for you will be ready at any time to open the door and
welcome Him.&nbsp; As the bride delights in the bridegroom, so
will you delight in Him.&nbsp; Your trial will consist, not in
the dread of His coming, but in the difficulty of patiently
waiting for His return, and when He comes you will find no
language to bless and praise His holy name for His boundless and
unmerited love in having redeemed you by His atoning blood; in
having called you by His sovereign grace; in having forgiven you
through His finished atonement: in having sanctified you by the
Holy Ghost; and in having preserved you in His own unchanging
faithfulness, <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>till He shall have finally presented you spotless and
faultless before the throne of His everlasting glory.</p>
<h2><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>JERUSALEM.</h2>
<p>There is no city in the whole world which fills so important a
place in the Word of God as Jerusalem.&nbsp; There are several
others which are more prominent in the world&rsquo;s politics,
but in the great economy of God, as revealed in Sacred Scripture,
Jerusalem stands out pre-eminent above them all.&nbsp; We
Englishmen think of London, with its vast population and enormous
wealth, as the leading city of the world; but except in so far as
it is the capital of one of the isles of the sea, it has no place
in prophecy.&nbsp; The French look upon Paris as the most
beautiful city of Europe, and the centre of European influence;
but, unless it is the predicted seat of the Beast, which some
persons are disposed to consider it, <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>it is literally nowhere in the Word
of God.&nbsp; And Rome, which all regard with something of awe
and veneration, as being associated with the most thrilling
histories of the past, is described in the Prophetic Word as the
seven-hilled city on which is seated the mystic Babylon, the
great whore of the Apocalypse.&nbsp; But the whole of Sacred
Scripture abounds in allusions to Jerusalem.&nbsp; History,
poetry, and prophecy are all full of it.&nbsp; It is described as
&lsquo;beautiful for situation,&rsquo; and &lsquo;the joy of the
whole earth.&rsquo;&nbsp; The people of God are taught to pray
for it, and the promise is given that those who love it shall
prosper.&nbsp; The sacred feet of the Son of God trod the
pavement of its Temple, and we are assured that it will never
disappear from God&rsquo;s great dealings with mankind, until the
New Jerusalem shall descend from heaven from our God, and there
shall be new heavens and a new earth at the coming of the Lord of
Glory.</p>
<p>It was the sight of this beautiful city, <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>with its
magnificent Temple crowning the heights of Mount Moriah, that
drew from our blessed Saviour the remarkable prophecy contained
in the 24th of St. Matthew and the 21st of St. Luke.&nbsp; The
disciples had pointed out to Him the buildings of the Temple; and
afterwards, as they sat together on the Mount of Olives, on the
opposite side of the valley, He taught them the vanity of all
earthly strength.&nbsp; He told them that of the beautiful Temple
not one stone should be left upon another.&nbsp; And He also
taught them that there would be a lengthened period of desolation
and humiliation; for that Jerusalem should be &lsquo;trodden
under foot of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles should
be fulfilled.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jerusalem was to be not merely beaten
down, but kept down, until a certain predicted period should
expire.&nbsp; But while the words distinctly predict a long
period of desolation, they no less clearly imply the assurance of
an ultimate restoration.&nbsp; They teach that <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Jerusalem is
not to be trodden down for ever, but only till the times of the
Gentiles shall be fulfilled; implying, as clearly as words can,
that when those times are expired, the Holy City shall rise again
in its beauty.&nbsp; The words predict a desolation for a limited
period, and at the close of that period, restoration.</p>
<p>I have not time to discuss what is meant by &lsquo;the times
of the Gentiles.&rsquo;&nbsp; Suffice it to say that I believe it
to be this present Gentile dispensation; this time of Gentile
power and Gentile opportunity; this time during which God is
gathering out His elect people from the Gentile world, and is
employing a Gentile Church in the sacred ministry of the Gospel
of His grace.&nbsp; It seems to be the time of the ingathering of
the Gentile Church, for it is to last, according to St. Paul,
&lsquo;until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in&rsquo;; and
it is clearly the time of the exercise of Gentile power, for they
are Gentiles by whom Jerusalem is to be trodden under foot.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>But I
do not wish to occupy time in any discussion of this period, but
rather to invite your special attention to those Gentile powers
which have trodden Jerusalem under foot.&nbsp; Which are they?
and how do they now stand?</p>
<p>What, then, are the Gentile powers which have trodden down
Jerusalem?&nbsp; In the course of the eighteen hundred years of
her humiliation there have been times during which there have
been short interruptions in the sway of the ruling powers.&nbsp;
But, looking at the period as one great whole, and fixing our
attention on the conspicuous outlines of history, we find that
there are two powers which stand out conspicuous above all the
rest as the great oppressors of the Holy City.&nbsp; These are
Rome and the successive forms of that Mahommedan power of which
the present head is Turkey.&nbsp; Rome trod her down at the siege
of Jerusalem, and Turkey holds her down now.&nbsp; Rome cast her
to the ground, and when she was down Turkey set its foot <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>on her
neck.&nbsp; Rome hurled her to the dust, and Turkey now tramples
her in the mire.&nbsp; Rome destroyed God&rsquo;s Temple, and
actually ploughed up the sacred ground on which it stood.&nbsp;
Turkey maintains on the sacred site the mosque of Omar; and on
that holy hill where Abraham offered Isaac, where David offered
the oxen of Araunah, where Solomon built his Temple, and where
the Lord Jesus, the Son of David, cast out all that was unholy;
there, by Turkish authority, now stands a Mahommedan mosque; and
there no Jew is permitted to set his foot, the only privilege
allowed him being to kneel in the Street of Wailing outside the
enclosure, and there weep for the desolation of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>There is something very remarkable in this fact, because these
are the two powers especially connected with the two great
predicted apostasies, Popery and Mahommedanism; Rome being the
seat of the Popedom, and the Sultan of Turkey the recognised head
of the Mahommedan apostasy.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>But I
have no time now to examine that connexion, nor is it my present
object to do so.&nbsp; The one fact I desire to leave perfectly
clear on your mind is this, that Rome and the Mussulman power of
which Turkey is now the head, are the two Gentile powers which
for the last eighteen hundred years must be charged with having
trodden down Jerusalem.</p>
<p>And now what is the present position of these two
powers?&nbsp; And how do they stand in Europe?&nbsp; What is the
condition, and what the prospect, of these two great oppressors
of Jerusalem?</p>
<p>As for Rome, as a political power it has ceased to exist, for
I need not say that the modern kingdom of Italy has nothing to do
with it.&nbsp; It is not built on the old lines, but is
altogether a new creation, an extension of the kingdom of
Sardinia.&nbsp; Now there can be no doubt whatever that the vast,
iron-footed, undivided Roman Empire, of which Titus was emperor
at the time he trod down Jerusalem, has long <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>since passed
away.&nbsp; Different historians may assign different dates to
its dissolution, but no one doubts for one moment that it is
dissolved.&nbsp; The power that trampled down Jerusalem is broken
up into ten kingdoms, and the Imperial head is no more.&nbsp;
There is no successor to the throne of Titus, and the throne
itself is in fragments.</p>
<p>It is very remarkable also that the Papal head which succeeded
the Imperial has within the past few years come also to an end as
a political power.&nbsp; After the division of the undivided
empire the ten kingdoms were to a great extent held together by
the Papal head which succeeded the Imperial.&nbsp; The Pope
claimed to be the sole authority from which the kings derived
their power, and before the Reformation, all Europe acknowledged
his claims.&nbsp; He was supposed to hold all the crowns of
Europe in his hand.&nbsp; But that is all over now.&nbsp; The
kings have taken away his dominion.&nbsp; As a political power
the Papal head has followed <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the Imperial.&nbsp; According to Sir
G. Bowyer, in the <i>Times</i> of Nov. 10, 1874, &lsquo;The Pope
has been dethroned, and all his dominions and property have been
reduced to a palace, a church, and a garden,&rsquo; it does not
seem, therefore, very probable that Rome in either shape will
ever again tread down Jerusalem.&nbsp; We may safely say that the
first of the two oppressors is no more.</p>
<p>But what shall we say of the second? of that Turkey which is
the only power now treading down Jerusalem?&nbsp; I would meet
this by another question.&nbsp; Is there any politician in Europe
who has the least expectation of Turkey remaining in its present
position for another ten years?&nbsp; Whatever little political
power it retains is dying out as fast as it can die.&nbsp; Its
exchequer is bankrupt.&nbsp; Its credit is gone.&nbsp; Its
character for good faith is at an end.&nbsp; Its armies are
unpaid.&nbsp; Its subject populations are rising against the
intolerable burdens of its injustice and oppression; and the
Turks themselves have lost heart in the melancholy <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>conviction
that their days are numbered.</p>
<p>Thus of the two powers that have trodden down Jerusalem, one
is already extinct and the head of the other at its last
gasp.&nbsp; The foot of the Sick Man is the only foot now
remaining on the neck of Jerusalem, and the Sick Man is
dying.&nbsp; Surely it is not unreasonable to ask the question,
&lsquo;When he dies, why should not Jerusalem arise and be
free&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The result is that, without dwelling on any minute detail, we
are brought by the great, long-continued facts of European
history, to the most important conclusion that, in all
probability, we are approaching the time when Jerusalem shall no
longer be trodden down of the Gentiles, and when therefore, the
times of the Gentiles shall be fulfilled.&nbsp; It is only
reasonable to suppose that when the oppressors are taken out of
the way the oppression will come to an end; and, therefore, as
one of those two oppressors is already fallen, and the other <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>falling so
fast that all the powers of Europe seem unable to keep him in his
place, there is surely good reason to hope that before long the
captive will be free, and that the time may not be far distant
when we shall hear the cry, &lsquo;Shake thyself from the dust;
arise and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of
thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And it certainly is a most remarkable fact that,
simultaneously with the consumption of Rome and the decay of
Turkey, there has been a wonderful awakening of interest in
Jerusalem and the Jews.&nbsp; The explorations in Palestine are
very like a fulfilment of the prophecy, &lsquo;Thy servants take
pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof&rsquo;: and
if they are, there is good reason to hope that &lsquo;the time to
favour her, yea, the set time, is come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the interest in the people is more remarkable than that in
the country.&nbsp; Before the great Evangelical revival at the <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>commencement of this century no one seemed to have any
idea that the Jews had any part in their own Messiah.&nbsp; They
were treated as an outcast people, and as for their conversion,
no one seems to have thought of attempting it until the formation
of the Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews, in the
year 1808.&nbsp; But now there are Christian missionaries
labouring amongst them in most of the principal towns of Europe,
and, indeed, in almost all the leading centres of their scattered
population.&nbsp; The New Testament has been translated into
Hebrew, and very nearly twenty-five thousand copies are being
annually circulated amongst the Jews.&nbsp; The state of feeling
towards them has passed through a complete revolution, so that of
England it was said not long since by a learned and influential
Italian Jew, &lsquo;God has blessed, and will bless, England;
because her great men, both in Church and State, take an interest
in the children of Jacob.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such facts are most
important <a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>in themselves; but when it is borne in mind that this
interest in Jerusalem has been awakened just at the time of the
consumption of the political power of Rome, and has been going on
side by side with the decay of Turkey, it certainly ought to lead
all students of the Word of God to consider carefully whether the
times of the Gentiles may not be drawing to a close, and the day
of redemption may not be beginning to dawn on Jerusalem.</p>
<p>But some may be disposed to say, How are we concerned with
Jerusalem, and what does it matter to us whether Jerusalem is
trodden under foot, or free?&nbsp; I fear this is a very common
feeling throughout society, and that there are thousands and tens
of thousands of professing Christians who are perfectly
indifferent as to the condition of Jerusalem.&nbsp; But it ought
not so to be, for if it be a place cared for by the Lord, it
ought to be also cared for by His people.&nbsp; Besides which,
even on selfish principles, we should take an interest in <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>Jerusalem;
for, as our position as Gentiles in Christ Jesus is most
intimately connected with the fall of Jerusalem, so our brightest
hopes in Him are bound up with its recovery.&nbsp; In proof of
this I would ask you to turn to Ps. cii. 16, where you read,
&lsquo;When the Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear in
glory!&rsquo;&nbsp; The return of the Lord is, therefore,
connected with the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and, whenever we see
His hand restoring the city, we should begin to look out in
confident hope for the glorious and happy day when He Himself
will come to take the Kingdom.&nbsp; As a student of the Word of
God, I should be very much surprised if He were to come before
Jerusalem is raised from the dust; but when it is raised, it
seems clear from Scripture that there will be nothing in the
great prophetic series any longer to delay His appearing. <a
name="citation102"></a><a href="#footnote102"
class="citation">[102]</a></p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>So in
our Lord&rsquo;s discourse, as recorded by St. Matthew and St.
Luke, we are taught the same thing.&nbsp; The object of the
discourse is not, as has been sometimes thought, to confound the
taking of Jerusalem with the Second Coming, but to distinguish
them, and to warn the disciples against the danger of mistaking
the siege of Jerusalem for the coming of the Lord.&nbsp; It is
the restoration of Jerusalem, not the fall, which is connected <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>with the
Advent.&nbsp; Our Lord, therefore, distinguishes between the fall
and the recovery and describes the various signs that shall
precede each.&nbsp; So up to Luke xxi. 24, we find the
description of the desolation, concluding with the prophecy,
&lsquo;Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the
time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.&rsquo;&nbsp; But in ver. 28 we
find the promise of the glorious recovery in those sacred words,
&lsquo;When these things begin to come <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>to pass,
then look up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth
nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 24th verse describes the desolation, the
28th the restoration, and the whole long period described as the
times of the Gentiles, with the signs of the latter days,
intervenes between the two.&nbsp; Now look at the account of the
redemption.&nbsp; It includes clearly a release from the
captivity and the rise of Jerusalem, when the time of its
treading down shall have come to an end.&nbsp; But that is not
all, or nearly so.&nbsp; The redemption there described is
identified with the return of the Lord Himself; for in ver. 27 we
read, &lsquo;Then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud
with power and great glory.&rsquo;&nbsp; Those then who pray for
the peace of Jerusalem will rejoice for Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake in
its recovery.&nbsp; Those servants of God who take pleasure in
her stones, and favour the dust thereof, will have their hearts
gladdened when they see her rebuilt.&nbsp; But that is not all,
or nearly all, for whenever that happens, the whole <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Church of
God, and every member of it in every nation under heaven, may
look up and lift up their heads, for the Lord Himself will soon
appear.&nbsp; Once more, then, are we taught our deep interest in
the decay of Turkey.&nbsp; When Turkey falls there is every hope
that Jerusalem will rise; and when Jerusalem rises, the next
thing for us to look out for will be the Advent of the
Lord.&nbsp; All Christians, therefore, should rejoice in the
decline of the Ottoman Empire, for the fall of the Mussulman is
the hope of the Jew, and the return of the Jew will be the
blessed harbinger of the triumphant advent of her glorious
King.&nbsp; Rome beat down Jerusalem, and Rome, as a political
power, is no more.&nbsp; Turkey is now treading her down; but its
decay is begun, and its days are numbered: so that we may
earnestly hope it will be but a little while, possibly a very
little while&mdash;within the lives of many present&mdash;when
the great promise of God shall be fulfilled, and, according to
the prophecy, &lsquo;The moon shall be confounded, <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>and the sun
ashamed, when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and in
Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.&rsquo;&nbsp; God
grant that all the readers of this little book may be found
looking for His appearing, and ready to welcome Him with their
lamps burning brightly, when the cry is heard, &lsquo;The
Bridegroom cometh!&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="footnote28"></a><a href="#citation28"
class="footnote">[28]</a>&nbsp; According to the census of 1911,
the population of the British Isles was 45,365,599, of which
number five millions were Romanists, so that clearly the
proportion is still diminishing.&nbsp; But it must be borne in
mind that her leading false doctrines and non-Scriptural claims
are being increasingly taught in this country.</p>
<p><a name="footnote37"></a><a href="#citation37"
class="footnote">[37]</a>&nbsp; Thirty-six years have elapsed
since these words were penned, and although Turkey has been
upheld by the European Powers, and has herself made one or two
brave efforts on the battlefield and in the matter of
constitutional reform, the process of decay has been rapidly
advancing; yet even so who, at the beginning of the year 1912,
could have foreseen the catastrophe which in a few short weeks
has almost wiped Turkey from the Map of Europe?</p>
<p><a name="footnote45"></a><a href="#citation45"
class="footnote">[45]</a>&nbsp; And actually the very walls of
Vienna.</p>
<p><a name="footnote47"></a><a href="#citation47"
class="footnote">[47]</a>&nbsp; Now in April, 1913, the four
Balkan States and Greece in a brief but bloody campaign have
brought Turkey apparently to her last gasp, and it is still a
matter of speculation whether she will be allowed to retain
possession of Constantinople and with it the merest thread of the
littoral of Europe.&nbsp; This has now taken place, and <i>The
Times</i> of May 30, in a leader upon the signing of the Treaty
of London, uses these epoch-making words&mdash;&ldquo;The Ottoman
Empire in Europe has now ceased to exist.&rdquo;&nbsp; June,
1913.</p>
<p><a name="footnote48"></a><a href="#citation48"
class="footnote">[48]</a>&nbsp; The word &ldquo;almost&rdquo; may
be removed, as Turkey in Africa has ceased to exist.&nbsp; The
war with Italy in 1912 deprived Turkey of Tripoli, and thus the
very last spot in Northern Africa emerged from the once
overflowing waters of Mahommedan power by which it had been
overwhelmed many centuries ago.</p>
<p><a name="footnote50"></a><a href="#citation50"
class="footnote">[50]</a>&nbsp; The number is rapidly
diminishing, and day by day streams of Turkish refugees are
pouring across the Bosphorus to the Asiatic side.</p>
<p><a name="footnote69"></a><a href="#citation69"
class="footnote">[69]</a>&nbsp; If the faithful preacher whose
clear foresight is recorded here were to witness what we now see,
would he not say, like St. Paul&mdash;&ldquo;as we also
forewarned you and testified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this book was published, Spiritualism, then recently
imported from America, was only beginning to make itself felt,
the destructive Higher Criticism, whose dry rot has now spread
its subtle influence on all sides, had not landed on our coasts
from Germany; the very names of Modernism, New Theology, and its
offspring the Liberal Christian League, were non-existent;
Christian Science had not then been imported to America from its
Eastern home; and several other heresies and imitations (2
Timothy iii. 8), which under the guise of deep spiritual teaching
are now crippling true spirituality and doing the Devil&rsquo;s
work, were still unborn.&nbsp; But they are with us now, and they
have come to stay.&nbsp; Let us recognize their <i>source</i> and
their <i>significance</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote79"></a><a href="#citation79"
class="footnote">[79]</a>&nbsp; The significance of this clarion
note of warning in connection with the events now taking place is
of the greatest possible importance.</p>
<p><a name="footnote102"></a><a href="#citation102"
class="footnote">[102]</a>&nbsp; It would be simply impossible in
a brief note even to enumerate all the recent amazing changes in
Jerusalem and the Holy Land.&nbsp; Since the fulfilment of a
prophetic epoch a few years ago, pointed out at the time by the
writer as an indication that the &ldquo;Times of the
Gentiles&rdquo; had virtually ceased, Jerusalem has for the first
time in her history been &ldquo;inhabited as towns without
walls&rdquo; (Zechariah ii. 4), the dwellings having spread
outside in rapidly increasing suburbs, which make it more like a
modern city than the Jerusalem of old.</p>
<p>Jews are permitted to hold magistracies and to perform civic
functions; they are also allowed to practice in medicine and in
the legal profession.&nbsp; Elementary and secondary schools are
established in which only the Hebrew language is used; banks and
various institutions are flourishing, and a new Hebrew university
is about to be founded.&nbsp; Jewish agricultural and
manufacturing colonies in large numbers are at work in different
parts of the land, and a recent number of the <i>Jewish World</i>
gives a long account of a visit a few weeks ago to these colonies
by the newly appointed Governor of Jerusalem.&nbsp; The visit was
an official inspection, and the result one of the greatest
possible importance to the Jewish nation.&nbsp; Amongst many
other things, the Governor (himself an Albanian) stated that he
was directed by the authorities in Constantinople to grant to
these colonies the right of electing their own councils and
appointing their own mayors, fixing rates, retaining some of the
Government taxes for their own use, enrolling their own police,
whose uniform and ammunition should be supplied by the Turkish

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
